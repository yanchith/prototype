Dear playtester,

Thank you for agreeing to help me test my prototype. I am going to address a few topics before you start.

While the prototype has interesting ideas, it also has serious design problems that are not ironed
out as of the current vesion.

Dungeons and Diagrams by Zachtronics was a big influence at the beginning of the project, and its
spirit still lingers here, albeit becoming fainter.

Part of that lingering spirit is that almost all levels from Dungeons and Diagrams are still present
in this game. If you already played them and want to skip, this game does tell you how.

The game is controlled with keyboard and mouse. It automatically saves progress.

The best feedback for me is a video recording of your playtest session (screen + audio + camera),
but if you can't or don't want to do that, careful notetaking while you play is the next best thing.

I am looking forward to your feedback!

Jan
