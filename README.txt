Hello,

This is all the source code of my summer 2025 game prototype.

The assets (textures, music, levels) are not present in this repository, because I am not 100% sure
I have the right to put all of them into the public domain. (I think I do, but I want to be sure
before I do something I shouldn't.)

The JAI compiler is also not yet in the public domain as of the time of writing this, but you would
build the developer build with:

  jai build.jai - -developer

... and the release build with:

  jai -release build.jai


However, you can play the browser version of the game at:
