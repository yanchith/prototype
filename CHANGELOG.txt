Version: 0.2.7, 18 November 2025
--------------------------------

Levels from Dungeons and Diagrams have been removed, because could be seen as a copyright violation.

Version: 0.2.6, 4 November 2025
-------------------------------

This is almost the same as 2025, but has a few things updated because of the web build.

Levels in first two areas now unlock in the general direction towards the next area.

Levels from Dungeons and Diagrams have been moved to their own set of areas, such that they can
easily be disabled, if necessary.

Version: 0.2.5, 14 October 2025
-------------------------------

Unless more low hanging fruit turns up, this is the last 0.2.x version. The 0.3.x versions will
contain major new features.

Added new puzzles gating access to the endgame of this prototype, as well as new endgame puzzles to
explore some of the combinatorics of the new mechanics.

A level in the first tutorial sequence had an alternative solution that enabled the player to avoid
understanding what the level was trying to teach. This is now fixed.

Fixed a minor bug where the players would not see the victory sparkles if they left and re-entered a level.

Slightly tweaked area and level name text position to cater to some late game levels.

Version: 0.2.4, 6 October 2025
------------------------------

Added graphics representing the wall around the dungeon board. This should hopefully better
communicate the properties of the edge of the board.

Changed visual representation of certain floating visual hint from green flashing lights to an
abstract symbol in the top left corner. Similar to numeric constraints, this symbol is changes color
to reflect how satisfied it is as the game board is being modified. The new version both better
communicates what the property is, and doesn't distract the player from other visual hints.

Changed visual representation of the remaining two floating visual hints. Now it should be clearer
that they represent errors, and it should be somewhat clearer what kind of errors they represent.

Version: 0.2.3, 2 October 2025
------------------------------

Made teaching puzzle sequence on first screen longer. Hopefully, this makes difficulty spikes less
pronounced. The tutorial is still very difficult.

Tweaked the early levels of the teaching sequence on the second screen to clarify some treasure
chest properties before the player finds a level that tests them on the knowledge of those
properties.

Added unique sound for attempting to edit a read only tile. Previously, this was the denied sound,
but that also plays when puzzle clues are not satisfied.

Fixed subtle incorrect usability behavior with one frame of latency when releasing a mouse button
and dragging the mouse, where the puzzle would still be painted on the frame the button was
released.

Changed to clear lingering visual hints on any attempt to modify the puzzle, instead of just
successful modifications.

Version: 0.2.2, 1 October 2025
------------------------------

Updated graphics to better communicate read-only tiles. Overall art ended up being slightly noisier
and uglier, but an important aspect is now communicated in a unified way, and not that the art was
particularly pretty before. This is all temporary art anyway, so clarity takes precedence.

Changed level behavior to flash and play denied effects when click starts on read-only tiles.

Version: 0.2.1, 27 September 2025
---------------------------------

The first version tracked by the changelog.

Includes crest mechanics, nonverbal tutorials, new puzzles and redesigns, and many bugfixes over the
0.1 version. Unless you believe the original animated tutorial scroll was better, 0.2 is superior
to 0.1 in every way.
